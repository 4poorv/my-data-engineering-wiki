## [SQL Variants](http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/)

There are multiple variants built by different companies which are built on top of the SQL Standard. They are roughly 95% similar in terms of syntax but each database may interpret them differently leading to optimization differences between databases.

The most common variants are:
-   [[T-SQL]] (Microsoft SQL Server)
-   [[PostgreSQL]] ([[PostgreSQL]])

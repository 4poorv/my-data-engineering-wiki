SQL stands for [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and is used for retrieving and manipulating data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

## [SQL Variants](http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/)

There are multiple variants built by different companies which are built on top of the SQL Standard. They are roughly 95% similar in terms of syntax but each database may interpret them differently leading to optimization differences between databases.

The most common variants are:
-   [[T-SQL]] ([[Microsoft SQL Server]])
-   [[PostgreSQL]] ([[PostgreSQL]])
-   [[MySQL]] ([[MySQL]])

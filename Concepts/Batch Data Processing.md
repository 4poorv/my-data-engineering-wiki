Batch processing is a term used to describe collecting, modifying, or exporting multiple data records at a regular cadence with downtime in betwen batches. Because large amounts of data can be processed all at once in these batches it can be a very efficient approach and is best suited for handling frequent, repetitive tasks. It is the most common form of data processing that fits most businesses data needs.

# Benefits
**Efficiency**
Batch processing allows a company to process data when computing or other resources are available. For example, a common schedule is to process data overnight when the database and servers aren't being used by employees. If data isn't frequently updated, you can simply change the batch processing schedule to make it less frequent as well.

**Simplicity**
Compared to [[Stream Data Processing|stream processing]], batch processing is usually less complex and doesn't require special hardware or system support for incoming data. Batch processing systems typically require less maintenance than stream processing.

**Processing Speed**
Because batch processing allows companies to process large amounts of data quickly, this speeds up procesing time and delivers data that companies can use in a timely fashion.

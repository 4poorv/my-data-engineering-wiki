A data unit test is an automated test you can create which ensures that the data coming through your data pipeline is what you expect it to be. Data unit tests are most useful for knowing when upstream data changes, when data is stale/cached, and preventing bad data from ruining machine learning models or public-facing reports and dashboards.

Creating data unit tests are also a good way of documenting what the data set should look like which you can then show a teammate or stakeholder and get on the same page quickly.

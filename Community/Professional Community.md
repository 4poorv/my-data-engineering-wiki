Separate from our learning community ([r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)), we run a smaller more focused community for data engineers in the field. We bring together professional Data Engineers who are looking to level up their skills, advance their careers, engage in meaningful discussions with industry experts, and gain practical knowledge so that we can become leaders in our field. [Click here to learn more and join](https://community.dataengineering.wiki/).

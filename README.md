# How to Contribute

2. Clone this repo.
3. Create a new branch and switch to it.
4. Open the repo in Obsidian.
5. Make any changes you like and save.

# Rules
1. Limit self-promotion. If you make money from a certain website, app, etc. please refrain from linking it as a source in your note.
2. Avoid making minor changes unless you are fixing a grammatical issue. If you are editing an existing note then the changes should be significantly different.
3. No shortened links using services like bit.ly.
4. At the top of each note should be the [YAML frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) that's found in every other note. In it, you can optionally specify one or more aliases to your note as well as tags. We currently arenâ€™t using any tags but that may change in the future.

# Contributing Rules

1. Contributions are more than welcome but we ask that you avoid making minor changes unless you are fixing a grammatical issue. If you are editing an existing note then the changes should be significantly different.
2. Limit self-promotion. If you make money from a certain website, app, etc. please refrain from linking it as a source in your note.
3. We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one major change it would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.

## Style Guidelines

- **Add [YAML frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) to each note**
	- Every note should contain this at the top of the note.
	- You can use this to specify aliases as well as tags.
	- We currently aren't using any tags but that may change in the future.
- **Use templates when starting notes**
	- You can find templates for the most common types of notes under the templates folder.
	- If you are using Obisdian, you can use the [Templates plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) for easy note creation.
- **Note naming conventions**
	- All note files should use the markdown format and end in the `.md` file extension.
	- File names should be title case and use spaces instead of hypens or plus symbols.

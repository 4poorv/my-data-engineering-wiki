There are a ton of different repositories and recommendations about where to find good datasets so we've compiled the best recommendations from other data engineers here.

**Start here:** https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

Google's dataset search engine makes it much easier to find datasets vs searching for datasets in a static GitHub repo.

Other tips:
- Lot's of local governments publish their datasets: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset
- If you need additional help finding a dataset you can ask the [r/datasets community](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)

> [!Tip]
> If you can't find a suitable dataset, another option is to create a dataset using a library like [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker).
